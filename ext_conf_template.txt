# cat=basic; type=string; label=TS configuration PID: PID of the page where to find the main typoscript configuration of GSA Admin (the page where you've integrated the static template of GSA Admin). Note: if your Typoscript template is stored in a sysfolder, you don't have to set the PID of the sysfolder here, but the PID of the page where the template is included/used!

# cat=basic; type=boolean; label=Enabled tax rate module: Flag whether the 'Tax Rates' backend module should be displayed/used. IMPORTANT: Do NOT use this module in combination with the ERP system since both do currently not work together (leads to ERP software crashes, overwritten DB records etc.)! If you use the ERP with the GSA Shop extensions, you should disable this module and administrate your tax rates with the ERP software.
